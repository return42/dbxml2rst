Normally XML tools are used to convert DocBook XML, e.g. XSL Style-sheets to
convert DocBook XML into various formats (examples:
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current). I haven't found any XSL
Template to convert DocBook to reST, and I'am not interested in developing
one. Thats why I compiled these small ``dbxml2rst`` toolbox, which uses existing
tools and *hacked* a bit around them.  The ``dbxml2rst`` uses the pandoc
converter and implements some XML-filters, where pandoc fails, e.g. cross
references in a multi-part DocBook document.

The migration of DocBook-XML is a working process and a task which is mostly
done by developers, not end users. This in mind, the ``dbxml2rst`` tools are not
*ready to go* for every one.  The ``dbxml2rst`` toolbox is useful for DocBook
to reST migration, it don't attempt to be a *converter* for a daily usage.
