Install
=======

This is a python 3 project (no python 2 support). First install python3 on your
OS, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu::

  sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip3

If you are a developer and like to contribute to the dbxml2rst library, to run
all make targets, you need also to install pylint3::

  sudo apt-get install pylint3

Next step is to clone the repository from github and install::

  git clone https://github.com/return42/dbxml2rst.git
  cd dbxml2rst
  make install
